# Zach Price - Eye Movement Exercise

**Eye Movement Exercise**

The Eye Movement exercise was a task given during my course, the objective was to create two eyes using HTML and what these eyes do is follow your cursor around the screen when you move your mouse around. 

**How to run**

To run the program, download the files, and double click "index". If all done correctly, you should see the program in your web browser and the two eyes moving around when you move your mouse.

**Roadmap of future improvements**

I do not intend to update the program anymore than it is, because it achieves exactly what I want it to do. I will add further updates if requested
